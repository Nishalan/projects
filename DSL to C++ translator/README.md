## Description
This project was completed by: **Nishalan Nair Revi Andran (revia001@umn.edu)** and groupmate **Michael Johannsen (johan393@umn.edu)** as our *Program Design and Development* project.

We create a program that takes in a Domain Specific Language program file (Forest Cover Analysis Language) and converts it into an executable C++ file.

This project was completed in December 2014.

Project consists of:
* Scanner that uses Regular Expressions to scan the DSL files (lexical analysis)
* Parser that receives input from the scanner and puts the tokens into a Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

The C++ syntax from the AST is then written into a file for user execution.
